        "description": "The Financial Statement is used to present evidence to the court. It is a written document that contains facts that you must swear under oath (usually on a Bible or other religious book) or affirm (non-religious promise) to be true. After you swear or affirm the affidavit, it is evidence of the facts and events it sets out, just as if you took the stand in a courtroom to provide those facts.",

The commissioner will check your photo ID to make sure you are who you say you are, ask you if you understand the contents of your affidavit, then ask you to swear or affirm that the contents are true. The commissioner will then watch you sign the document before signing it themselves.<br><br>If you do not speak or read English, you can bring an interpreter with you when you meet with the commissioner. For information about interpreters and language help, click on the Language Resources link on the bottom toolbar.<br><br>Lawyers, notary publics and many court registry staff are commissioners for taking oaths. You can go to any <a target='_blank' href='https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=5AD9441AEBD9428FA6EF86D6B1E39E96'>Provincial Court Registry</a> or <a target='_blank' href='https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=FD6DB5BA2A5248038EEF54D9F9F37C4D'>Service BC location</a> to swear or affirm the affidavit. If you have the document sworn or affirmed at a different court registry, you will still need to file it at the court registry where the existing case is filed."
